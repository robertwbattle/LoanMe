# Solana Loan Platform

A decentralized lending platform built on Solana that enables peer-to-peer loans with customizable terms.

## üèó Project Structure

The project consists of three main components: # LoanMe

LoanMe is a decentralized lending platform built on **Solana**, enabling users to create, manage, and repay loans in a trustless environment. The platform leverages **Anchor** for Solana smart contracts, **Flask** for backend APIs, and **SQLite** for lightweight data storage.

## Features

- **Loan Management**: Borrowers can request loans, and lenders can fund them.
- **Solana Smart Contracts**: Powered by Anchor to ensure security and transparency.
- **Wallet Integration**: Users can generate and manage Solana wallets.
- **Payment Processing**: Borrowers can make repayments via smart contracts.
- **API-Driven**: Exposes RESTful APIs for frontend integration.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/robertwbattle/LoanMe.git
cd LoanMe
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
#### Backend Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Solana & Anchor (For Smart Contracts)
Ensure you have **Anchor & Solana CLI** installed:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli
```
Verify installation:
```bash
solana --version
anchor --version
```

## Configuration

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables  
Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory and configure:

```env
SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="[YOUR_SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY]"
PROGRAM_ID="[YOUR_DEPLOYED_PROGRAM_ID]"
TATUM_API_KEY="[YOUR_TATUM_API_KEY]"
TATUM_API_URL="[TATUM_API_ENDPOINT]"
```

### 2. Set Up SQLite Database
```bash
cd backend
python setup_db.py  # Initializes the database
```

## Running the Project

### 1. Start the Flask Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
The API will be available at **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

### 2. Deploy the Smart Contract
```bash
cd anchor
anchor build
anchor deploy
```

## API Endpoints

### User Management
- **POST** `/api/account` - Create a new user account
- **POST** `/api/generate-wallet/<user_id>` - Generate a Solana wallet for a user

### Loan Management
- **GET** `/api/loans/<loan_pda>` - Get loan details
- **POST** `/api/loans` - Create a new loan
- **POST** `/api/loans/<loan_pda>/payments` - Make a payment on a loan

### Deployment & Debugging
- **POST** `/api/deploy` - Deploy smart contract
- **GET** `/api/deploy/<signature>` - Get deployment status

## Debugging

### Check Solana Logs
```bash
solana logs
```

### Check Transaction Details
```bash
solana transaction <SIGNATURE> --verbose
```

### Run Local Tests
```bash
anchor test
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Frontend React Integration
- [ ] WalletConnect Support
- [ ] Multi-currency Loan Support
- [ ] Enhanced Smart Contract Security

## Security & Auditing

LoanMe uses **Solana‚Äôs security best practices**, but as an open-source project, we encourage audits and contributions to improve the platform.
